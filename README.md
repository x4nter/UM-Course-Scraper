# UM-Course-Scraper

A Python script that pulls course information for the University of Manitoba from [aurora](https://aurora.umanitoba.ca/banprod/bwckschd.p_disp_dyn_sched) and organizes the data into a neat json format.

The department and the term can be changed by updating the `dept` and `term` variables in the main function.
